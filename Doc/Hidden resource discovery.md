# Hidden resource discovery
Taipan allows to identify hidden resources. With hidden resource I mean any content that is not directly accessible by direct web application navigation. Example of hidden content are 
test pages, backup files or any URLs which is not directly navigable.

This process is based on _wordlist_ of keywords. Taipan allwos to customize this process by specifing a possible extension to use during the scan. The profile that you must use in order 
to execute an hidden discovery scan is *Identify hidden resources* (you can see it by running Taipan with the command _--show-profiles_).
